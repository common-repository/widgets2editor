*  It will also add new widget "TinyMCE Templates" witch is just like text widget but without title beeing displayed.
*  You can add any widget in the Tiny Templates sidebar, and you will be able to insert that widget output in editor.
*  Widget titles will be hidden in editor, wraped with <span style="display:none;"></span>, or if you insert TinyMCE Template widget you won't get title at all
*  Once in editor, you will see "insert predefined template content" button.
*  When you click on that button, you will get the popup where you can select, preview and insert all defined templates from Tiny Templates sidebar.
